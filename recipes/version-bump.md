            Goal: keep the package.json version aligned with the impact of changes.

            Review the PR changes and decide whether a version bump is needed:
            - Breaking changes -> major.
            - New backward compatible features -> minor.
            - Backward compatible bug fixes, security fixes, dependency updates -> patch.
            - Internal-only changes, no runtime changes -> none.

            If you recommend a bump:
            - Comment on the PR with a short summary explaining the reason for the bump.
            - Include the current version and the proposed version in a diff-style code fence:
              ```diff
              - version: <current>
              + version: <proposed>
              ```
            If you do not recommend a bump, do not comment.
